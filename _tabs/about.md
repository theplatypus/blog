## Welcome to my personal page

Hi, I'm Nicolas, a Data Engineer and Scientist with a PhD in Computer Science, living in the lovely town of Morlaix in Brittany. My professional path has been driven by a keen interest in understanding and solving complex data-related challenges.

### What I'm Passionate About

- **Graph Theory**: The cornerstone of my PhD thesis, this field fascinates me with its endless applications and theoretical challenges.
- **Data Engineering**: I enjoy diving into DBMS data models and figuring out how to make data systems more efficient and reliable.
- **Data Science**: I love its explorative nature, and discovering new insights through analysis.
- **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence**: Hard to get bored about this vast and ever-changing field, offering endless opportunities for learning and application

This blog is a place where I share useful insights and tips I've picked up along the way. Whether it's a piece of code, a new way of looking at a problem, or a tool that's saved me time, I hope you'll find something here that helps you in your own work.

### Curriculum

If you're interested in a detailed overview of my professional background, you can find my complete curriculum at [theplatypus.github.io/online-cv/](https://theplatypus.github.io/online-cv/).

### Beyond Work

#### Books I Recommend

- [**Programmation Efficace**](https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/accueil/3853-programmation-efficace-128-algorithmes-quil-faut-avoir-compris-et-codes-en-python-au-cours-de-sa-vie-9782340010055.html) by Dürr Christoph and Vie Jill-Jênn: Essential for anyone who codes.
- [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) by Martin Kleppmann: A great resource that explores the foundations and applications of data systems, illustrated with an [informative poster](https://github.com/ept/ddia-references/blob/master/ddia-poster.jpg).

#### Fun Facts

Did you know that graph are so versatile that their generalization (hypergraphs) can themselves be represented as graphs?

#### Hobbies

Outside of data and coding, I have a few hobbies:
- **Photography**: See [mine](https://theplatypus.myportfolio.com/)
- **Piano**: Playing music is a wonderful escape of my work.
- **Magic: The Gathering**: Easy to learn, impossible to master.
- **Running**: Proud marathonian.
